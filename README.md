UPDATE: this is the old repo and will no longer be updated; <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jmatthewgriffis/Space_Odyssey_2_complete">the new one can be found here</a>. It was necessary to create another repo to replace this one because this one was created to hold only a single app and the project eventually expanded to include additional apps and other files. However, most of the history of the project can be viewed in this repo.

----------

Space Odyssey 2 was and is created by me, J. Matthew Griffis, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sheva29">Mauricio Sanchez-Duque</a>, as a collaborative final project for:

Parsons MFA Design and Technology - 
Fall 2013 semester - 
Algorithmic Animation

My other work for that class can be <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jmatthewgriffis/griffis_algo2013">found here</a>.
